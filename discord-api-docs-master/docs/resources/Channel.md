### Message Object

Represents a message sent in a channel within Discord.

###### Message Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | snowflake | id of the message |
| channel\_id | snowflake | id of the channel the message was sent in |
| author* | a [user](#DOCS_USER/user-object) object | the author of this message (not guaranteed to be a valid user, see below) |
| content | string | contents of the message |
| timestamp | timestamp | when this message was sent |
| edited\_timestamp | ?timestamp | when this message was edited (or null if never) |
| tts | bool | whether this was a TTS message |
| mention\_everyone | bool | whether this message mentions everyone |
| mentions | array of [user objects](#DOCS_USER/user-object) | users specifically mentioned in the message |
| mention\_roles | array of [role object](#DOCS_PERMISSIONS/role-object) ids | roles specifically mentioned in this message |

* The author object follows the structure of the user object, but is only a valid user in the case where the message is generated by a user or bot user. If the message is generated by a webhook, the author object corresponds to the webhook's id, username, and avatar. You can tell if a message is generated by a webhook by checking for the `webhook_id` on the message object.

## Message Formatting

Discord utilizes a subset of markdown for rendering message content on its clients, while also adding some custom functionality to enable things like mentioning users and channels. This functionality uses the following formats:

###### Formats

| Type | Structure | Example |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| User | `<@USER_SNOWFLAKE_ID>` | `<@80351110224678912>` |
| User (Nickname) | `<@!USER_SNOWFLAKE_ID>` | `<@!80351110224678912>` |
| Channel | `<#CHANNEL_SNOWFLAKE_ID>` | `<#103735883630395392>` |
| Role | `<@&ROLE_SNOWFLAKE_ID>` | `<@&165511591545143296>` |
| Custom Emoji | `<:NAME:ID>` | `<:mmLol:216154654256398347>` |

Using the markdown for either users, roles or channels will mention the target(s) accordingly.

## Get Channel % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_CHANNEL/channel-objects}

Get a channel by ID. Returns a [guild channel](#DOCS_CHANNEL/guild-channel-object) or [dm channel](#DOCS_CHANNEL/dm-channel-object) object.

See [message formatting](#DOCS_CHANNEL/message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.

>warn
> This endpoint supports both JSON and form data bodies. It does require multipart/form-data requests instead of the normal JSON request type when uploading files. Make sure you set your `Content-Type` to `multipart/form-data` if you're doing that. Note that in that case, the `embed` field cannot be used, but you can pass an url-encoded JSON body as a form value for `payload_json`.

###### JSON Params

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| content | string | the message contents (up to 2000 characters) | true |
| nonce | snowflake | a nonce that can be used for optimistic message sending | false |
| tts | bool | true if this is a TTS message | false |
| file | file contents | the contents of the file being sent | one of content, file, embeds (multipart form data only) |

>info
> For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

###### Using Attachments within Embeds

You can upload attachments when creating a message and use those attachments within your embed. To do this, you will want to upload files as part of your `multipart/form-data` body. Make sure that you're uploading files that contain a filename, as you will need a filename to reference against.

In the embed object, you can then set an image to use an attachment as its url with our attachment scheme syntax: `attachment://filename.png`

For example:

```json
{
	"embed": {
		"image": {
			"url": "attachment://screenshot.png"
		}
	}
}
```

>warn
> Only filenames with proper image extensions are supported for the time being.
